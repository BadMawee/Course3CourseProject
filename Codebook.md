The units of the data set for every variable having a name associated with acc(accelaration),
accjerk(jerk),gyro(angular velocity),gyrojerk(angular jerk) has a unit of g,g/s, rad/s, rad/s^3 respectively.

The following are the variables described in this data set.

Note: 
There are several values with appended with X, Y and Z at its end. This indicate the direction of such values, and those with similar name has similar description.
